# Exported Types

You will be able to use the module generated types for custom purposes (like typing props)
They are all importable from `@typed-router` alias

## `TypedRouteList`

`TypedRouteList` is an union type regrouping all the registered route names of your app.

```vue
<script setup lang='ts'>
import {TypedRouteList} from '@typed-router';

const props = defineProps<{
  routeName: TypedRouteList
}>();
</script>
```

## `TypedRouter`

`TypedRouter` is the type returned by `useRouter`.  
It's an extension of `vue-router.Router` with type abilities.

```ts
import {TypedRouter} from '@typed-router';

declare const customRouter: TypedRouter
```

## `TypedRoute`

`TypedRoute` is the default type returned by `useRoute`.  
It's an extension of `vue-router.Route` with type abilities.

It includes a discrimated union for name/params type-check, meaning it can type check itself when doing a type guard check on its name.

```vue
<script setup lang='ts'>
import {TypedRoute} from '@typed-router';

const props = defineProps<{
  route: TypedRoute
}>();

if (props.route.name === 'foo-bar') {
  console.log(props.route.params.bar);
}
</script>
```

## `TypedNamedRoute<T>`

`TypedNamedRoute` is the secondary type returned by `useRoute`.  
It's a genereric type and it's first type argument is the route name.

It's used when calling `useRoute` with a route name assertion.  
You can use it to infer the correct route params given a route name;

```ts
import {TypedNamedRoute, TypedRouteList} from '@typed-router';

function getMyRoute<T extends TypedRouteList>(name: T): TypedNamedRoute<T> {
  // 
}

```


## `TypedRouteParams`

`TypedRouteParams` is a dictionnary containing the route names as key and their params as values

This type is meant to be used for programmatic navigation.

Exemple output

```ts
export type TypedRouteParams = {
  index: never;
  'user-foo-bar': {
    foo: string | number;
    bar?: string | number;
  };
  'user-id-slug-articles': {
    id?: string | number;
    slug?: string | number;
  };
  user: never;
  'user-posts-slug': {
    slug: (string | number)[];
  };
  'user-test-optional': {
    optional?: string | number;
  };
};
```


## `ResolvedTypedRouteNamedMapper`

`ResolvedTypedRouteNamedMapper` is a partial discrimanated union type that regroups each route name and their params.  
This type is meant to be used for resolved routes.

Exemple output
```ts
 export type ResolvedTypedRouteNamedMapper = {
  name: TypedRouteList;
  params: unknown;
} & (
  | { name: 'index' }
  | {
      name: 'user-foo-bar';
      params: {
        foo: string;
        bar?: string;
      };
    }
  | {
      name: 'user-id-slug-articles';
      params: {
        id: string;
        slug: string;
      };
    }
  | {
      name: 'user-id-slug';
      params: {
        id: string;
        slug: string;
      };
    };
```

::alert{type="info"}
In this type, we have a default intersection. It's useful because it means if we don't make a type guard for the route name, the `params` property will still be accessible
