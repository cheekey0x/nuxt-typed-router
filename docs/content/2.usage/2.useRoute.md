# useRoute


**Normal usage (in components)**

If you have a `[foo].vue` page file, you can safely check the route name with the returned route object.


```vue
<script setup lang='ts'>

const route = useRoute();

if (route.name === 'foo') {
  console.log(router.params.foo) // types-check
}
</script>
```

But if you have a `[foo]-[[bar]].vue` page file, the `bar` param will be correctly infered as optional in the `route` object


```vue
<script setup lang='ts'>

const route = useRoute();

if (route.name === 'foo-bar') {
  console.log(router.params.foo) // string
  console.log(router.params.bar) // string | undefined
}
</script>
```


**Assertion usage (in pages)**

You can also invoke `useRoute` directly with a route name to have it type check its params.
For exemple, if you're editing `pages/profile/[id].vue`, you can directly do this and save time.

```vue
<script setup lang='ts'>

const route = useRoute('profile-id');

console.log(route.params.id) // types-check
</script>

```

If you have a `pages/[foo]/user/[bar].vue` file, both `foo` and `bar` params will be typed
